# 1052. Grumpy Bookstore Owner

**Difficulty:** Medium

There is a bookstore owner that has a store open for `n` minutes. You are given an integer array `customers` of length `n` where `customers[i]` is the number of customers that enter the store at the start of the `i`th minute and all those customers leave after the end of that minute.

During certain minutes, the bookstore owner is grumpy. You are given a binary array `grumpy` where `grumpy[i]` is `1` if the bookstore owner is grumpy during the `i`th minute, and is `0` otherwise.

When the bookstore owner is grumpy, the customers entering during that minute are not **satisfied**. Otherwise, they are satisfied.

The bookstore owner knows a secret technique to remain **not grumpy** for `minutes` consecutive minutes, but this technique can only be used **once**.

Return the **maximum** number of customers that can be **satisfied** throughout the day.

## My Approach
The right pointer is incremented by the for loop, while the left pointer is not directly incremented but is advanced based on the **fixed size** of the window.

## My Solution
### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxSatisfied(self, customers: List[int], grumpy: List[int], minutes: int) -> int:
        n = len(grumpy)
        original_cus = sum(customers[i] for i in range(n) if grumpy[i] == 0)
        
        # initialise the first window
        window = sum(customers[i] for i in range(minutes) if grumpy[i] == 1)
        max_window = window
        
        # slide the window
        for i in range(minutes, n):
            window += grumpy[i]*customers[i]
            window -= grumpy[i-minutes]*customers[i-minutes]
            max_window = max(max_window, window)
        return original_cus + max_window
```

### Notes:
The edge case check where `minutes >= n` is unnecessary because the for loop won't run in this case, and Python will naturally exit the loop without needing an explicit condition. However, if the sliding window is implemented using a while loop, this edge case must be explicitly handled.
